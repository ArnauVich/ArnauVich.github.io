I am a computational biologist with a special interest on the gut microbiota and its relation to human health. My scientific work is focusing on the identification of the changes in the gut microbiome in patients with gastrointestinal disease, in particular inflammatory bowel diseases and irritable bowel syndrome. Via the integration of multi-omics data, I have investigated genetic mechanisms and environmental factors that influence the gut microbiota composition. Currently, my interest lays on the study of host-microbes and microbe-microbe metabolic interactions and in the translation of our current knowledge on the human microbiota into clinical applications. In my spare time, I closely follow (international) politics, and have a passion for road cycling.
