excerpt: 'We described the bacterial composition and metabolic potential of the small intestinal microbiota. The colonic microbiome of IBD patients, particularly with intestinal resections, showed resemblance to that of the small intestine. Moreover, several features characterising the small intestinal microbiome have been previously associated with IBD. These results highlight the importance of studying the small intestinal microbiota to gain new insight into disease pathogenesis'
